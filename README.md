>This is my 3rdish attempt at creating a website. Initially, using angular had been too much of a hurdle and I gave up very quickly. Now it's become more of something I look forward to doing and thinking about. And to help in my journey of becoming more organized in my thoughts/design thinking and being able to plan out what I'm going to do before trying to do it, this will be a (living) documentation breaking this website into parts.
