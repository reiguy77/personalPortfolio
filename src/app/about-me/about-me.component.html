                    From the moment I took my first computer science class as a freshman, my journey into the world of coding has evolved into a lifelong passion. Over the past 9 years, I have immersed myself in the art of creation, continuously honing my skills, and embracing the process of learning and exploration. If you're curious, I invite you to take a look at my developer journey. <a href="/about-me#my-developer-journey">Discover it here</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Beyond the realm of coding, my interests span a range of interdisciplinary fields, including applied math, music, and health. When I look at the world around us, I am captivated by the vast expanse of data waiting to be tapped into and understood. By analyzing this data, we can uncover our own behavioral patterns and unravel the intricacies of the systems that shape our lives.
                    My ultimate aspiration is to craft innovative products and tools that empower individuals to reach their full potential and become the best versions of themselves.
